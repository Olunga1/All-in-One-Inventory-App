# All-in-One-Inventory-App

Feature Guide

User Account & Onboarding
What it does: Users create an account quickly using Google or Apple ID.
How it works: Integrate Google and Apple authentication (use Firebase Auth or a similar service). Ask only for the essentials during sign-up.
Make onboarding fun and interactive so users can set up their first inventories with ease. Connect app data to Hubspot CRM.
Main Dashboard/Home Screen
What it does: Shows a simple overview for each category: Fridge, Closet, Shoes, and Furniture.
How it works: Make a clean main screen with clickable cards for each category. Each card shows a quick summary (like total items or alerts). Tapping a card takes users to that category’s detailed list.
Add Items (for All Categories)
What it does: Lets users add items in three ways: typing them in, scanning a barcode (for groceries), or taking/uploading a photo.
How it works: Use the camera for barcode scanning (with ML Kit or ZXing). Allow photo uploads and filling in details for each item.
Fridge: Name, food type, expiration date, amount, where it is (shelf/drawer).
Closet: Name, type (e.g. shirt, dress), color, size, season, photo.
Shoes: Name, brand, size, color, type, photo.
Furniture: Name, room, type, year bought, condition, photo. Let users add similar items in bulk if needed.
Edit, Delete, or Move Items
What it does: Change item details, remove items, or move them to another category/location.
How it works: Enable easy edit/delete functions. Use swipe or long-press in item lists.
Inventory Categorization & Tagging
What it does: Lets users sort and tag items with custom labels (for easy searching and organizing).
How it works: Provide tagging/autocomplete. Allow users to make their own categories and tags.
Search & Filtering
What it does: Powerful search; find anything fast by category, tag, expiration, unused/worn, etc.
How it works: Create a flexible search bar. Add filters that can be combined (like “all unworn red shirts”).
Reminders & Notifications
What it does: Reminds users when:
Fridge items will expire
Closet or shoes haven’t been worn recently
Furniture needs care/maintenance
How it works: Use local notifications that users can customize in Settings.
Shopping & Restock Lists
What it does: Makes shopping lists for missing/expiring fridge items; lets users make wishlists for clothes, shoes, or furniture.
How it works: Users can add items to lists manually; app can auto-suggest based on what’s low or running out.
Usage Stats & Analytics
What it does: Shows stats: most/least used items, how much food is wasted, rarely used clothes/shoes, etc.
How it works: Display these in simple dashboards with graphs or charts.
Room/Location Management
What it does: Lets users organize everything by rooms or locations.
How it works: Users can create rooms/locations in the app and drag/drop or reassign items as needed.
Sharing & Data Export
What it does: Lets users share their inventories or lists with others (family/roommates) and export data as a CSV.
How it works: Allow sharing through links or invites, and give an “export to email/CSV” option.
App Settings
What it does: Lets users set notification preferences, switch between light/dark theme, or manage their account.
How it works: Provide a simple Settings page; save user preferences locally or in their profile.
Pricing Model
Free: The first three items in each category (Fridge, Closet, Shoes, Furniture) are completely free.
Paid: To add more than three items in any category, users upgrade for just $5 per month.
